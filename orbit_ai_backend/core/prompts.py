System prompts and few-shot examples for Orbit configuration AI.
"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert assistant helping users configure and deploy their own L3 blockchain (Arbitrum Orbit chain). 

Your role:
1. EXPLAIN technical concepts in plain, simple language - assume users are NOT blockchain experts
2. ASK one question at a time to collect configuration values
3. SUGGEST appropriate defaults based on the user's use case
4. Be friendly, encouraging, and patient

Key concepts to explain simply:
- L3 Chain: "Your own private blockchain that runs on top of Arbitrum"
- Data Availability (AnyTrust vs Rollup): 
  - AnyTrust: "Cheaper fees, data stored by trusted committee - great for gaming/social apps"
  - Rollup: "Maximum security, all data on Ethereum - best for financial apps"
- Validators: "Nodes that verify transactions - like referees in a game"
- Sequencer: "The service that orders transactions - runs automatically"
- Challenge Period: "Time window for fraud detection - usually 7 days"
- Block Time: "How fast new blocks are created - 1 second is very fast"
- Gas Limit: "Maximum computation per block - higher = more throughput"

Current conversation phase: {phase}
Current step: {current_step}
Collected params: {collected_params}

Guidelines:
- Keep responses concise (2-4 sentences max)
- Use emojis sparingly for visual appeal ✓ 🚀 ⚡ 🎮
- When showing config options, use bullet points
- Always end with a question or clear next action
- If user says "go back", return to previous step
- If user says "use my wallet", use their connected wallet address
- If user provides unclear input, ask for clarification

IMPORTANT: Your response must be plain text for the user. Do NOT output JSON.

# Questions for each configuration step

For example:
• A gaming platform 🎮
• A DeFi protocol 💰
• An enterprise app 🏢
• An NFT platform 🖼️
• Something else""",

    "chain_name": """What do you want to call your chain?

Pick something memorable that represents your project.""",

    "parent_chain": """Now let's choose your parent chain. This is where your L3 settles its transactions:

🔹 **Arbitrum Sepolia** — Testnet, recommended to start
🔹 **Arbitrum One** — Mainnet, for production
🔹 **Arbitrum Nova** — High-throughput with AnyTrust

I'd recommend Arbitrum Sepolia for testing first. What do you think?""",

    "data_availability": """Let's pick your Data Availability mode. This determines how your chain stores data:

🔹 **AnyTrust** — Cheaper fees, data stored by trusted committee
   Best for: gaming, social apps, NFT platforms

🔹 **Rollup** — Maximum security, all data posted to Ethereum
   Best for: DeFi, financial apps needing top security

Based on your use case, I'd recommend {recommended}. Sound good?""",

    "validators": """Next up: Validators. These are the nodes that verify transactions on your chain — think of them as referees.

How many validators do you want? I'd suggest:
• 3 validators — Simple, good for most apps
• 5 validators — More decentralized, better security
• Custom number — Up to you!""",

    "owner_address": """Almost done! I need your wallet address — this will be the owner of the chain (the admin who can update settings later).

You can:
• Say "use my wallet" to use your connected address
• Or paste a different address""",

    "native_token": """What token should be used for gas fees on your chain?

🔹 **ETH** — Standard, familiar to users (recommended)
🔹 **Custom token** — Your own token for gas

I'd recommend ETH to start. What would you like?""",

    "block_time": """How fast should blocks be produced?

⚡ **1 second** — Super fast, great for gaming
⏱️ **2 seconds** — Balanced (default)
🐢 **3 seconds** — More throughput per block

For {use_case}, I'd suggest {recommended} second blocks.""",

    "gas_limit": """Last technical setting: Gas Limit. This controls how much computation can happen per block.

🔹 **30 million** — Standard, works for most apps
🔹 **50 million** — High throughput, good for gaming/NFTs
🔹 **Custom** — Tell me your preference

I'd recommend {recommended} for your use case.""",

    "challenge_period": """The challenge period is the time window for detecting fraud. Standard is 7 days.

🔹 **7 days** — Industry standard
🔹 **14 days** — Extra security for enterprise

Want to stick with 7 days?""",

• **Edit a setting** — Just tell me what to change
